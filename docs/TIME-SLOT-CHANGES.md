## Questions & Answers

### Q: Why 1-hour sessions instead of 2-hour sessions?
A: Business requirement change to allow more flexible scheduling and accommodate more merchants per day.

### Q: Why is 12pm-1pm now available?
A: The new schedule allows training during lunch hours. Trainers can manage their own lunch breaks around bookings.

### Q: What about the 14:30 slot - why not 14:00 or 15:00?
A: Business requirement to have a gap between lunch session (ends 1pm) and afternoon session (starts 2:30pm).

### Q: Do we need to update the database?
A: No, time slots are defined in code, not stored in database.

### Q: What happens to existing bookings in old time slots?
A: They remain valid. Only new bookings use the new time slots.
