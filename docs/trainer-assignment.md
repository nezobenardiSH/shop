# Trainer Assignment Rules

## Overview

This document defines the rules for assigning trainers to merchants based on service type, location, and language requirements.


## Service Type Classification

The system determines trainer assignment based on the **Onboarding Services Bought** field from Salesforce (`Onboarding_Services_Bought__c`).

### Onsite Training
**Service Types:**
- `Onsite training`
- `Onsite Training`
- Any variation containing "onsite"

**Filtering Criteria:**
1. ✅ **Language Match** - Trainer must speak selected language(s)
2. ✅ **Location Match** - Trainer must cover merchant's geographical area
3. ✅ **Calendar Availability** - Trainer must be free at selected time

**Location Categories:**
- **Within Klang Valley**: Kuala Lumpur, Selangor, Putrajaya
- **Penang**: Penang state
- **Johor**: Johor state
- **Outside of Klang Valley**: All other Malaysian states

**Example:**
```
Merchant: Nasi Lemak Restaurant
Location: Kuala Lumpur
Language: Bahasa Malaysia
Service: Onsite training


→ Location Category: Within Klang Valley
→ Filters to: Nezo (covers "Within Klang Valley", speaks Bahasa Malaysia)
```

### Remote Training
**Service Types:**
- `Remote Full Service`
- `Online Training`
- `Remote training`
- Any variation containing "remote" or "online"

**Filtering Criteria:**
1. ✅ **Language Match** - Trainer must speak selected language(s)
2. ❌ **Location Match** - NOT required (training is remote)
3. ✅ **Calendar Availability** - Trainer must be free at selected time

**Example:**
```
Merchant: Nasi Lemak Restaurant
Location: Kuala Lumpur
Language: Bahasa Malaysia
Service: Remote Full Service

→ Filters to: All trainers who speak Bahasa Malaysia
→ Result: Nezo, Jia En, Izzudin (all speak Bahasa Malaysia)
```

### No Service Type / Unknown
**Behavior:**
- Schedule button is **disabled**
- User cannot book training
- System displays message: "Please contact support to set up onboarding service"

## Location Categorization Logic

### How Location is Determined

The system categorizes merchant locations into four categories based on their address:

1. **Within Klang Valley**
   - Includes: Kuala Lumpur, Selangor, Putrajaya
   - Default category if no location is detected
   - Covers the greater Klang Valley metropolitan area

2. **Penang**
   - Includes: Penang state (Pulau Pinang)
   - Detected by keywords: "penang", "pulau pinang", "p. pinang", "pg", "pn"

3. **Johor**
   - Includes: Johor state
   - Detected by keywords: "johor", "johor bahru", "jb", "j.b"

4. **Outside of Klang Valley**
   - All other Malaysian states not covered above
   - Examples: Perak, Kedah, Kelantan, Terengganu, Pahang, etc.
   - Currently no trainers assigned to these areas

### Location Detection Algorithm

```typescript
function getLocationCategory(address: string | null): string {
  if (!address) return 'Within Klang Valley' // Default
  
  const states = extractStatesFromAddress(address)
  
  // Check if within Klang Valley
  if (states.includes('Kuala Lumpur') || 
      states.includes('Selangor') || 
      states.includes('Putrajaya')) {
    return 'Within Klang Valley'
  }
  
  // Check specific states
  if (states.includes('Penang')) return 'Penang'
  if (states.includes('Johor')) return 'Johor'
  
  // All others
  return 'Outside of Klang Valley'
}
```

## Implementation Logic

### Service Type Detection

```typescript
function getServiceType(onboardingServicesBought: string | null): 'onsite' | 'remote' | 'none' {
  if (!onboardingServicesBought) return 'none'
  
  const service = onboardingServicesBought.toLowerCase()
  
  // Check for onsite training
  if (service.includes('onsite')) {
    return 'onsite'
  }
  
  // Check for remote/online training
  if (service.includes('remote') || service.includes('online')) {
    return 'remote'
  }
  
  // Unknown service type
  return 'none'
}
```

### Trainer Filtering Flow

```
1. Check Onboarding Services Bought
   ↓
2. Determine Service Type (onsite/remote/none)
   ↓
3. If 'none' → Disable Schedule button
   ↓
4. If 'onsite' → Filter by Language AND Location
   ↓
5. If 'remote' → Filter by Language ONLY
   ↓
6. Check Calendar Availability
   ↓
7. Show Available Slots
```

## Intelligent Trainer Assignment Strategy

### Priority-Based Assignment Logic

When multiple trainers are available for a time slot, the system uses an intelligent assignment strategy to maximize scheduling flexibility:

**Core Principle:**
> Prioritize trainers with limited language capabilities first, reserving multilingual trainers for sessions requiring their specialized language skills.

**Assignment Algorithm:**

1. **Language Filtering**
   - Filter available trainers to only those who speak ALL required languages
   - If no trainers match all languages, fallback to trainers who speak at least one required language

2. **Specialist Prioritization**
   - Sort qualified trainers by language count (ascending)
   - Prioritize trainers with fewer language capabilities
   - Reserve multilingual trainers for sessions where their additional skills are needed

3. **Load Distribution**
   - If multiple specialists have the same language count, randomly select among them
   - This distributes workload evenly among trainers with similar capabilities

### Example Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: English Training in Klang Valley

**Available Trainers:**
- John Lai: English only (1 language)
- Vwie: English, Malay, Chinese (3 languages)

**Assignment:**
- ✅ **Assign: John Lai** (specialist with 1 language)
- 🔒 **Reserve: Vwie** for Malay or Chinese sessions where John cannot serve

**Rationale:** Maximize scheduling flexibility by keeping the multilingual trainer available for requests requiring Malay or Chinese.

---

#### Scenario 2: Bahasa Malaysia Training

**Available Trainers:**
- Nezo: English, Bahasa Malaysia (2 languages)
- Jia En: Bahasa Malaysia, Chinese (2 languages)
- Izzudin: Bahasa Malaysia (1 language)

**Assignment:**
- ✅ **Assign: Izzudin** (specialist with 1 language)
- 🔒 **Reserve: Nezo & Jia En** for English/Chinese sessions

**Rationale:** Izzudin is the specialist for Bahasa Malaysia only. Reserve Nezo for English sessions and Jia En for Chinese sessions.

---

#### Scenario 3: Multiple Specialists Available

**Available Trainers:**
- John Lai: English only (1 language)
- Sarah: English only (1 language)
- Vwie: English, Malay, Chinese (3 languages)

**Assignment:**
- ✅ **Randomly select: John Lai OR Sarah** (both specialists with 1 language)
- 🔒 **Reserve: Vwie** for multilingual sessions

**Rationale:** Both John and Sarah are equally specialized. Random selection distributes workload evenly between them.

---

#### Scenario 4: Multilingual Requirement

**Required Languages:** English + Chinese

**Available Trainers:**
- John Lai: English only (1 language) ❌ Cannot serve
- Vwie: English, Malay, Chinese (3 languages) ✅ Can serve
- Sarah: English, Chinese (2 languages) ✅ Can serve

**Assignment:**
- ✅ **Assign: Sarah** (specialist with 2 languages)
- 🔒 **Reserve: Vwie** for sessions requiring Malay

**Rationale:** Sarah is the specialist for English+Chinese. Reserve Vwie for sessions requiring all three languages.

### Benefits of This Strategy

1. **Maximizes Scheduling Flexibility**
   - Keeps versatile resources available for complex requests
   - Reduces scheduling conflicts for specialized language requirements

2. **Optimizes Resource Utilization**
   - Deploys specialists strategically
   - Prevents over-reliance on multilingual trainers

3. **Improves Service Coverage**
   - Ensures rare language combinations can be served
   - Balances workload across the trainer team

4. **Fair Load Distribution**
   - Random selection among equal specialists prevents favoritism
   - Distributes bookings evenly across trainers with similar capabilities

## Trainer Coverage Matrix

| Trainer | Languages | Locations | Language Count | Assignment Priority |
|---------|-----------|-----------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Izzudin** | Bahasa Malaysia | Johor | 1 | 🥇 Highest (for Bahasa Malaysia) |
| **Nezo** | English, Bahasa Malaysia | Within Klang Valley | 2 | 🥈 Medium |
| **Jia En** | Bahasa Malaysia, Chinese | Penang | 2 | 🥈 Medium |

**Assignment Examples:**
- **English only** → Nezo (only option)
- **Bahasa Malaysia only** → Izzudin (specialist, 1 language)
- **Chinese only** → Jia En (only option)
- **English + Bahasa Malaysia** → Nezo (only option)
- **Bahasa Malaysia + Chinese** → Jia En (only option)
